# Token Utility

BPAD is the currency token of BCHPad which will be used to access IDOs:

* **for investors:** it'll serve as a check before participating in an IDO.
* **for token owners:** it'll serve as a means of payment to have an IDO; >$1,000 of BPAD is required.
* **community rewards:** projects wanting to do a presale on BCHPad will be required to make an allocation for BPAD token holders which will later be distributed as airdrops to token holders.
