# Setting up your wallet for smartBCH

In order to work with the smartBCH network, you will need to use the MetaMask wallet. You can install MetaMask on your Chrome browser or install the Metamask app on your phone.

**Once installed, please follow the guide below to connect your MetaMask wallet to the BSC network**

Step 1: Click on the network dropdown. Next, select "Custom RPC".

Step 2: A form will appear, where you need to enter certain parameters to connect to the smartBCH network.

In this form, enter the following:

* **Network name:** smartBCH
* **New RPC URL:** [<mark style="color:green;">https://smartbch.greyh.at</mark>](https://smartbch.greyh.at)<mark style="color:green;"></mark>
* **ChainID:** 10000
* **Symbol:** sBCH
* **Block Explorer:** [<mark style="color:green;">https://smartscan.cash/</mark>](https://smartscan.cash)<mark style="color:green;"></mark>

Step 3: Once the sBCH network is added to your MetaMask, switch from Mainnet Ethereum Network to Smart Bitcoin Cash.



Unlike the Ethereum network, where-in the transaction fees are paid in ETH, Smart Bitcoin Cash charges fees in the sBCH token. Once you've switched from the Ethereum network to sBCH, sBCH will be displayed as the main token, instead of ETH.

Please note:

* Metamask works with the sBCH network in the same way as it does with the Ethereum network. The fees on the sBCH network are paid with BCH (i.e., ETH is replaced with BCH, whereas ETH, with rare exceptions, is not used by the network)
* In some cases, MetaMask may display the BCH tokens in your wallet as ETH (but always keep in mind that they are not)
* Your wallet address on both the Ethereum and BCH networks is the same. If you've previously used the Ethereum network and you have assets stored there, these assets will not be displayed after you switch to BCH (because your assets are stored on the other blockchain). The assets will show up again after you switch back to Ethereum.
* Ethereum network's token standard is ERC20.
* BCH network's token standard is SEP20.
