# How our KYC works

### BCHPad **KYC is only for Project Owners**

At **BCHPad,** we take the safety of our investors very seriously. We don't tolerate scams and frown at such act. Because of that, we have brought it upon ourselves to **KYC** project owners.



### How it works:

The identities of the project owner(s) are determined by submitting ID documentation (Passport, National ID)



### What does it mean for investors?

If any of the KYC'ed project(s) team scams such as rugpulling investors:&#x20;

* We will reveal their identities.
* We will report them to their local authorities.
* We will make their information public for those wanting to file a lawsuit.
