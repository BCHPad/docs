# Apply for IDOs and Staking

### Launchpads (Token Sales)

"IDO" (Initial Dex Offering) is a new model of token sale pioneered by BCHPad. Here's how it works:

* Project owners purchase >$1,000 of BPAD tokens which is then sent to [<mark style="color:green;">@rhyker</mark>](https://t.me/rhyker) on telegram and then vested for two months to be released back to the project owners.
* Investors participate in the IDO by holding the set amount of BPAD token i.e our contract checks if you hold the required amount of tokens required to access a sale. IDO fees will no longer be collected from holders.
* Immediate refund to investors if the presale doesn't get completed.

### Staking/Farm

Staking incentivize users to provide liquidity for your trading pair but users still get the risk of suffering an Impermanent Loss. To avoid the risk of users facing an Impermanent Loss, we have introduced a feature which allows users to stake a single token to earn a reward token. i.e stake BPAD to earn flexUSD
